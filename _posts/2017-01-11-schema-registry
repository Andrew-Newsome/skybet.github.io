Within Sky Betting & Gaming kafka is used for various reasons, the one that I currently work with is the Gaming Promotions Service which use Kafka for the delivery of real time notifications which are then exposed to the Gaming front end. Kafka is a distributed streaming platform which you can send and recieve streams of records, with countless stop offs in between, it also lets you store records on a fault tolerant platform. Used by giants like Netflix and Twitter to handle real time information from their customers, the Gaming tribe currently use this for the notifications service among others.
