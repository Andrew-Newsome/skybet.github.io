Once upon a time the DBA was a gatekeeper.  They owned the databases, and the servers were special snowflakes that nobody was allowed to touch.  Optimisations were hand coded in, and deployed manually.  The DBA was a superhero who could make things go faster by tweaking indexes or changing where clauses.  This kind of attitude is no longer acceptable, lets look at some of the ideas discussed at this year's All Your Base conference about what a database engineer should be.

The modern database engineer's manifesto should be all about the mission, protecting the data, eliminating waste, and using data to make decisions.  Like their children, their databases aren't special snowflakes, and can be replaced.  We should be eliminating the barriers between software and ops, sharing knowledge and learning each other's tools.

With databases no longer treated as special snow-flakes, we can introduce the whole of the ops team to taking care of them through automation, monitoring, and continuous integration and testing.  We work together towards removing failure scenarios to the point where failed database servers won't be noticed by the customer.

By sharing knowledge and prioritising the company's mission over the database servers, we can work together to perform proper risk assessments of database upgrades.  By looking at how critical the data is, how clients will interact with the new version, how mature the sofware and organisation are, we make a much better judgement call on the risks of any given upgrade and we know what to expect when it happens.  There should be fewer surprises.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs can be applied to databases, from the physiological - is the data available, through safety - are their replicas, to love and belonging - is configuration management and continuous integration used, right up to self actualisation - is this the right technology.  This can fit quite nicely with the a set of core values that the infrastructure team might have.

A set of core values might be a prioritised set of goals from basic data integrity though automation, up to zero-touch ops and reducing the amount of moving parts.

And lets not forget the vendors.  We give some of them a really hard time, often quite rightly so.  Technology has come an awful long way of the past few years, the huge number of types of database now available is an indicator of this.  But we're still a long way from being perfect.  Benchmarks lie, nobody talks about what their product is bad at, and our continuing use of single-master servers is a real problem for availability.
