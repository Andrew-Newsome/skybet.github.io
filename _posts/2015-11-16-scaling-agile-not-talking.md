We've recently expanded out of our initially Leeds-only operation into the neighbouring city of Sheffield. This worked out very well for me as I live in Sheffield and I think it's a great place to live and work.

We're also hoping that it'll be good for the rest of the local technology community, and decided to host an [event](http://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/skybet-sheffield-tech-talk-tickets-18871318622) a couple of weeks ago so people could get to know us. Our evening of three technical talks seemed to go down pretty well with the locals - especially the free pizza and drinks.

The first of these talks is now available for your viewing pleasure. This features myself talking about some of our experiences in scaling up our operation while retaining the agility which we believe has made us successful so far.

I'll also be giving this talk again at the upcoming [PHPem unconference](http://phpem.uk/event/unconference-2015).

The other two videos from that evening should be available in the coming weeks, and we also hope to host similar events in the future. Please let us know in the comments if you have any thoughts about what you'd like to see from us.
